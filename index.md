# Basic Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design

<a target="_blank" href="https://gregmiranda.com">Greg Miranda</a> (Instructor)

This course focuses on two main topics: The basics of organizing data for
efficient computation, and the design of programs that use collections,
classes, and interfaces.

Each week, we will explore topics in these areas interactively during lectures.
You will read beyond what we explore in lecture, complete programming
assignments to hone your coding and program design skills, and take exams that
test your understanding of what you've learned. After, you'll be better at
designing and understanding programs and the structure of data they work
over.

This web page serves as the main source of announcements and resources for the course, as well as the syllabus.

### <a id="b:lec">Lecture</a>

Most lecture content will be presented asynchronously through videos and readings. These will come with associated quizzes that are due on the following Monday, Wednesday or Friday at the start of our originally-scheduled lecture time. The quizzes are required work to demonstrate your consistent engagement with the material.

In our originally-scheduled lecture time, we will have an opportunity for live questions, clarifications, and some prompts for you to work on beyond the assigned reading and videos. Attendance is encouraged but not required. The sessions are 30 minutes.

Recordings of relevant classwide discussions will be posted after the meetings, though the selected videos/reading for the given day are the official ‚Äúlecture‚Äù for that day.

You can visit the lectures via Zoom links provided in Canvas.

### <a id="b:disc">Discussion</a>

Discussions will reinforce concepts from class and introduce concepts that
are especially helpful for completing programming assignments. Students from
either section can attend either discussion. They will be recorded. Attendance is encouraged but optional. 

Zoom links for the discussion sections will be posted in Canvas.

### <a id="schedule">Schedule</a>

The schedule below outlines topics, due dates, and links to assignments. If you check the schedule at the beginning of the week, you‚Äôll know when all reading quizzes, programming assignments, etc. will be due. We will often have the schedule confirmed more than a week out, but we‚Äôll strive to be up to date with the current week.

You are responsible for checking this schedule and
completing work by the deadlines given, which are always at 11:59pm local San Diego time on the listed date.

## <a id="staff">Staff</a>

We have a large instructional staff to help with your learning, and a few kinds of help sessions you can attend.

<iframe width="100%" height="800px" style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid grey; border-spacing: 2px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRelEhSTgev4Lz72isky67hQ9a22OHTug4UJq9wucsAFsB_LoTIFrxkkvP8hVT9ufY4QVtpEuy0ii9u/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>

The first is **office hours**, held by the TA and instructor. Office hours are a great place for any kind of question about the course, from help with your assignment to clarifications about material in lecture to questions beyond what we cover in the course. 

The Zoom links to office hours will be posted in Canvas. When you join the meeting, you will be placed into a waiting room until the TA or instructor admits you to the meeting. 

The second is **open lab hours** where tutors give one-on-one help with programming tasks and course content. For these sessions, you should submit a ticket on https://autograder.ucsd.edu to request help. 

* Give a meaningful question or problem statement in your ticket.
* Be prepared! You should be ready to reproduce the issue you‚Äôre having, have a test case that doesn‚Äôt produce the right output, show them a drawing of the situation you‚Äôre confused about, etc.

Once a tutor accepts your ticket, they will post a link to their Zoom meeting. When you join that meeting, you will be placed into a waiting room briefly until the tutor admits you to their meeting. After you join the meeting, the tutor will chat with you to help you with your issue, and then you will leave the meeting. 

Expect to have about 5 minutes with a tutor (or TA or instructor): you probably won‚Äôt have the solution at the end of the conversation, but you should feel un-stuck and ready to try new approaches.

The student procedures for open lab hours can be accessed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JpgsHIsVqoligF8AE3uLoACkSb1RRqxQy2FJX8ivDhU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

Below is the calendar for office hours and open lab hours.

The third is **through Piazza**. Online discussion and Q&A for the class will be available on Piazza. Important announcements from the course team will be pinned at the top of your feed. When you set up your account, you can select the frequency for email notifications of messages and discussions on Piazza.

For each programming assignment, we‚Äôll make a frequently-asked questions discussion on Piazza. You should refer to that during the assignment if you get stuck or have questions come up; we‚Äôll use it to aggregate common issues. You can feel free to comment publicly on those discussions, but do be conscious that other students can see what you post, so posting solution code for a project or an answer for a homework is an academic integrity violation.

The default is that posts are private to discourage accidentally over-sharing solution code. If your post is a question about content, lecture, course technology, logistics, etc, please do ask it publicly so others can benefit from the answer.

Finally, you can always send a private message on Piazza to ask any question about the course. Please don‚Äôt message individual course staff privately unless they‚Äôve asked you to, and please don‚Äôt message only the instructor with a content question. The course staff as a whole works together to make sure these messages get prompt responses (often by adding to the frequently asked questions post).

<h4>Asking & Answering questions on Piazza</h4>

Both we (the course staff) and your classmates can answer your questions on Piazza. There are a few kinds of questions you should ask on Piazza:

- Private questions about closed programming assignments for clarification
- Private questions about your grade / account
- Public questions about open programming assignments
- Public questions about the content of lecture, discussion, lab, and any readings

When answering questions, be polite, be clear, and assume the best intentions of the person asking. If it turns out you make a
mistake or were wrong, admit it with a smile (emoji are great for this üòä), and make sure the correct information is clear.
Above all, keep in mind that the course is a community whose goal is to foster a positive learning environment for everyone.

For public discussion, note that answers from your classmates are not official! They could be downright wrong or misleading,
completely by accident. ‚ÄúMy classmate said so on Piazza‚Äù is not a legitimate justification in most arguments, though they may
indeed lead you in helpful directions.

### <a id="b:materials">Materials</a>

There is no required textbook for the course. 

There is a ZyBook available that has been used in the past. You can purchase a
subscription and use it at your convenience; it serves as a useful reference
and is organized in the order material is presented in this course, and there
will be links to relevant ZyBooks sections in with the course schedule. There
is also a significant amount of reference material at the end of the book for
review of Java concepts. To get access to the book:

1. Sign in or create an account at <a href="http://learn.zybooks.com">learn.zybooks.com</a>
2. Enter zyBook code: UCSDCSE12MirandaFall2020
3. Subscribe

We may use other on-line resources during the quarter that may be required
reading or activities. These will all be free and linked from the schedule.

<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/11/" target="_blank">The
documentation for the Java language</a>, while not required reading, will be
linked to from some assignments and is always a useful reference while
programming. We will be using Java version **11** for the programming
assignments in this course, which is available at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html">Oracle's web site</a>.

You'll be submitting your classwork and seeing grading feedback through a
tool called <a href="http://gradescope.com/" target="_blank">Gradescope</a>.

## <a id="programming">Programming</a>

Most weeks, you will be working on a programming assignment for this class.
There are several specific policies in place regarding programming
assignments, and you should pay careful attention to them.

### <a id="p:open-closed">Collaboration</a>

**This is not the same collaboration policy you have seen in your other
programming courses. Read it carefully.**

In your professional programming life, some of your work will be highly
collaborative with lots of expert advice available from senior developers and
from sites like StackOverflow. This is a common case in companies, in
academia, and on open-source projects. It's a great way to get exposed to new
techniques, share knowledge, and generally enjoy teamwork. In contrast, some
of your work will involve figuring out programming problems on your own,
where you are the first person to encounter an issue, or the first person to
try using a new library in the context of your application. You should get
experience in both types of situations; we might call the former kind of
problem **open to collaboration** and the latter **closed to collaboration**.

In terms of courses, this split also makes sense. Programming assignments
serve (at least) two roles. First and foremost, they are a mechanism for you
to learn! By directly applying the techniques and skills we discuss in class,
you get practice and become a better programmer. Second, they are an
assessment mechanism ‚Äì as instructional staff we use them to evaluate your
understanding of concepts as demonstrated by your programs. Open
collaboration can reduce frustration while learning and give you chances to
enjoy collaboration and lots of help, but may not let us accurately evaluate
your understanding. Closed assignments are an opportunity for
you to demonstrate what you know by way of programming.

There are two types of assignments in this course, **open** and **closed**:

- **Open** assignments, for which you can talk to anyone else
  in the course, post snippets of code on Piazza, get lots of help from TAs,
  and generally come up with solutions collaboratively. TAs will be happy to
  look at your code and suggest approaches and fixes.
  
  There are a few restrictions:
  - Any code that you didn't write must be cited in the README file that goes
    along with your submission

    **Example:** On an open assignment, you and another
    student chat online about the solution, you figure out a particular
    helper method together. Your README should say ‚ÄúThe FOO function was
    developed in collaboration with Firstname Lastname‚Äù

    **Example:** On an open assignment, a student posts the
    recursive method calls they used to solve a problem you were
    struggling with. Your README should say ‚ÄúI used the code from
    https://piazza.com/class/id-of-post‚Äù.

  - Anyone you work with in-person (**please follow all social distancing guidelines**) must be noted in your README

    **Example:** You and another student sit next to each other,
    and point out mistakes and errors to one another as you work through
    the assignment. As a result, your solutions are substantially similar.
    Your README should say ‚ÄúI collaborated with Firstname Lastname to
    develop my solution.‚Äù
  - You cannot share an entire repository of code or paste an entire solution
    into Piazza. Keep snippets to reasonable, descriptive chunks of code; think
    a dozen lines or so to get the point across.
  - You still _cannot_ use code that you find online (no copying code
    from StackOverflow or blogs online), or get assistance or code from
    students outside of this offering of the class. All the code that is
    handed in should be developed by you or someone in the class.
  - You are responsible for _understanding_ all the code you have written.
    All of the programming problems on the PAs may show up on exams, where
    you will need to have a thorough understanding of the PA to answer the
    questions.


  This doesn't mean the staff will be handing out answers. We'll mostly
  respond with leading questions and advice, and you shouldn't expect a
  direct answer to questions like ‚Äúam I done?‚Äù or ‚Äúis my code right?‚Äù

  There is no guarantee the assistance you get from your classmates is
  correct. It is your responsibility to use your judgment to avoid using an
  idea on Piazza that is wrong, or doesn't work with your solution; we won't
  necessarily tell you one way or another while the assignment is out.

  If we see that you used code from other students and didn't cite it in the
  README, the penalty will range from a point deduction to an academic
  integrity violation, depending on the severity. Always cite your work!

- **Closed** assignments, where you cannot collaborate with others.
  You can ask clarification questions and report potential issues as private
  posts on Piazza or to staff members. However, staff will not look at your
  code or comment on it. Lab/office hours these weeks are for conceptual
  questions or for questions about past assignments only, no code assistance.
  Treat these assignments like take-home exams.

  On closed assignments:
    - You cannot look at or use anyone else's code in any way.
    - You cannot discuss the assignment, even in general terms, with anyone
      other than the course staff.
    - You should expect that staff members will politely say ‚ÄúThe course
      policy says I can't help with that‚Äù if you ask a question about your
      algorithm or code.
    - You cannot post publicly about the assignment on Piazza or elsewhere
      online.
    - All of the examples in the open section above would be
      academic integrity violations.

Programming assignments will explicitly list whether they are open or closed
collaboration.
